# TripSplit
This is an Android App I created as an exam-project. The assignment was to create an Android App in 3 days time. What you were going to build was up to yourself.

The idea of the app is that you can create trips and invite friends so everyone who's joining in on the trip can see all expenses made for this trip. Then afterwards the 'admin' of the trip can split all costs to each of the trip-members.
